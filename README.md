# Presentation_Portfolio
This project was an assignment for an advanced, graduate level data analytics course taken at American University. The project focused on analyzing global currency exchange rates and worked within the Xaringan package in R to create a 4 slilde presentation presenting my analysis. I sought to track the relative strength of several of the world's most important reserve currencies and analyze how their exchange rates with the U.S. Dollar. The data used to underpin this research comes from the U.N. annual report on global exchange rates. The most recent data availible is from 2022, as 2023 numbers are still being compiled by the U.N. Ultimately, the data showed that the Australian and Canadian dollars were weakest against the U.S. dollar over the past 15 years wheras the British Pound and Swiss Franc were the strongest. This project pushed me to sharpen my data visualization skills in addition to helping me establish a proficiency in creating academic presenations in RMarkdown.
